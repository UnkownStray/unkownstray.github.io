                such as watching television every day, going on vacation overseas, or endless nights of playing video 
                games, without having too many worries about world economic conflicts in life. I hope to obtain this 
                dream of paradise through my abnormal ambition for coding, find and get employed in a high paying job 
                in a good company, and retire early with loads of wealth for the future. I sometimes have visions that 
                the money I earn would help my descendants with any unexpected obstacles, such as finances, college 
                tuition, and many other things. However, to achieve this imaginary utopia, I have to work effortlessly 
                in my education to shape it into reality, which begins with this very moment in college. Each upcoming 
                challenge is a stepping stone to achieve my long dream goal I have planned for the future.</b></p>
