            <p class="paragraph"><b>I believe this assignment is a stepping stone to my dream goal, which is getting employed in an 
                information technology security company. Back when I was working as a secretary, the company would 
                mostly have technology problems that would sometimes be beyond repair, whether it was for the organization's
                website or the computers within the building. The problem was so chaotic that customers would sometimes 
                come in to complain about their device not working on the company’s website.  
                </b></p>
            <p class="reflectionp"><b>However, I think that learning the HTML/CSS language could have helped find a solution to the company’s website problem. I also think that 
                learning HTML/CSS can also lead me to other job opportunities that have the same or higher pay as an information 
                technology security expert, such as a website designer. Although this assignment has taught me that determination 
                isn’t the only thing that makes a person a hard worker, but the patiences and the effort they put into each task.
            </b></p>
            
            <p class="reflectionp"><b>When I started this assignment, I was determined and was very impatient to complete this task within one day. 
                However, like a candle flame, my motivation was snuffed out within mere hours. With the lack of motivation, 
                I would lose time scrolling through my phone.
            </b></p>

            <p class="reflectionp"><b>Later, I knew that hours had passed, and the assignment due date 
                was closer. Knowing this, I went back to working on the assignment, spending the remaining days to complete it. 
                Eventually, I finished the assignment.
