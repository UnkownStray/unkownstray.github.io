                                project requirements were that the game should be at least sixty seconds long, have 
                                multiple stages or difficulty levels, the user should be able to move the character 
                                by using the keys on the keyboard, and, most importantly, it must be a simple design 
                                and very challenging. So I built a game where the player can move the character with 
                                the arrow keys on the keyboard, must survive for eighty seconds, and the stage of 
                                difficulty changes after every twenty seconds have passed while they play the game.

                                excitement because of how simple it was to build a minigame with very few lines of code 
                                involved with the program, which surprised me.

                                LEGO Mindstorms. I used two LEGO Mindstorms, one for competing and one to control the 
                                other LEGO Mindstorm. I built the one for the competition with claws, so it can grab 
                                and drag the opposing LEGO Mindstorm robot out of the arena ring. I programmed the 
                                second LEGO Mindstorm to send signals to my other LEGO Mindstorm, so I could control
                                the arena built robot like a gladiator drone.</b></li>

                                the challenge gave the winner a prize of their choosing, I mostly participated to further

                                during summer camp. The project required a minimum of three levels, with each level 
                                being at least sixty seconds long, player should be able to control the character on 
                                screen, and a boss battle must be embedded in the game. I created three different levels,
                                each representing a difficulty. The first level I created is a game that is similar to a 
                                game called Flappy Birds. The second level is an updated version of the survival game I 
                                created, and the third level is a boss level where the player has to survive for two minutes.
