            <p class="paragraph"><b>My purpose and dedicated goal is to have too much free time on my hands, 
                such as watching television every day, going on vacation overseas, or endless nights of playing video 
                games, without having too many worries about world economic conflicts in life. I hope to obtain this 
                dream of paradise through my abnormal ambition for coding, find and get employed in a high paying job 
                in a good company, and retire early with loads of wealth for the future. I sometimes have visions that 
                the money I earn would help my descendants with any unexpected obstacles, such as finances, college 
                tuition, and many other things. However, to achieve this imaginary utopia, I have to work effortlessly 
                in my education to shape it into reality, which begins with this very moment in college. Each upcoming 
                challenge is a stepping stone to achieve my long dream goal I have planned for the future.</b></p>
