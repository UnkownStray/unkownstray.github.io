                I’m a first year undergraduate information technology student at the University of Missouri. Back in high school,
                I was enrolled in an early college program called P-TECH, which was also known as Pathways in Technology. This 
                allowed any students in the program to take college classes for dual credit since my freshman year. I have studied
                programming for over four years and graduated with honors, Dean’s List, an associate degree in science, network
                administration, and security, and a U Certify certificate. However, I believe that there is more to learn about
                programming and all of the different languages, so I enrolled in the University of Missouri to expand my knowledge
                of programming through lessons from professionals and hoped to find and make friends with other students who might
                share the same interest in programming as me.
